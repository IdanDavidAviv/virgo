# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Readme Preview Read Aloud" extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Architectural Refactoring (Phase 3)**: Decoupled monolithic state from `SpeechProvider` into a centralized, reactive `StateStore`.
- **Atomic State Lifecycle**: Implemented `StateStore.reset()` to ensure synchronous, global state clearing and prevent session leakage.
- **Unit Testing Suite**: Established a dedicated `/tests` directory and integrated `vitest` for high-integrity logic verification (11/11 tests passing).
- **Logical Modularization**: Extracted document parsing and loading into a standalone `DocumentLoadController`.

### Changed
- **SpeechProvider**: Refactored to a pure coordinator pattern, delegating business logic and state management to isolated services.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Neural Voice Caching Optimization**: Implemented voice-aware cache keys and persistent storage for audio data, enabling instant voice switching without re-synthesis.
- **Surgical Preview Mode**: Introduced a "Preview First" strategy for voice selection that synthesizes only the current sentence and defers document-wide prefetching.
- **Prefetch Guarding**: Throttled background synthesis tasks to prevent Azure TTS server exhaustion and state leakage during active playback.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Added high-density shorthand logging for cache hits, cache misses, and synthesis lifecycle management.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Serverless Architecture**: Fully decommissioned the legacy `BridgeServer` infrastructure, eliminating port collisions and installation locks on Windows.
- **Native Webview Messaging**: Migrated all extension-to-dashboard communication to the native VS Code `postMessage` protocol.
- **Improved UI Sync**: Restored the "Row X / Y" tracking and header state synchronization for a professional playback experience.
- **Direct Diagnostics**: Implemented a console-to-extension bridge to redirect webview logs directly to the "Read Aloud" output channel.
- **Voice Stabilization**: Standardized voice changes to immediately purge local audio caches and reset playback state.


## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Selection Sync Multiplexer**: Implemented a 100ms debounced focus tracker in `extension.ts` to prevent race conditions during rapid tab switching or window resizing.
- **Ghost Focus Strategy**: Now prioritizes the active tab group's state when the sidebar is focused, ensuring the dashboard never loses context while you're interacting with it.
- **Enhanced Selection Guard**: Automatically clears "Focused File" area when an unsupported document type is active.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Interactivity**: The **LOAD FILE** button now correctly disables (with a "ghosted" visual state) whenever "No Selection" is shown, providing clearer feedback on readable files.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Webview Scoping**: Resolved fatal `ReferenceError` caused by incorrect block-scoping of DOM elements in `dashboard.js`.
- **Initialization Protocol**: Consolidated `acquireVsCodeApi()` calls and added a defensive handshake sequence to prevent startup crashes.
- **Expanded Recognition**: Relaxed document filters to support `.txt` and `.log` files in the Sidebar.
- **Diagnostic Layer**: Implemented a console-to-host logging bridge to capture and persist webview errors for rapid recovery.

### Removed
- **Redundant Commands**: Removed `readme-preview-read-aloud.read-selection` as selection handling is now integrated into the main flow.
- **Legacy Assets**: Deleted `media/simple.html`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Smart Port Isolation**: Dev sessions now use port 3002 to prevent handshake collisions with installed production instances.
- **Dynamic Versioning**: extension version is now dynamically injected from package.json into the dashboard.

### Removed
- **Neural Synthesis UI**: Cleaned up legacy premium toggles for a streamlined native experience.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Initial Release

- **Mission Control Dashboard**: Glassmorphism UI for session management.
- **Robust AST Parsing**: Accurate sentence mapping via `markdown-it`.
- **Intelligent Navigation**: Skip sentences, jump sections, or read from cursor.
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux native synthesis.
- **Resource Hygiene**: Proactive audio blob management for long sessions.
- **Production Bundling**: Optimized activation via `esbuild`.
